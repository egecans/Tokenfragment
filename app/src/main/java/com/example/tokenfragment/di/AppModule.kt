 * don't need to define them everytime to call those. The only thing to do is @Inject method before you call those values
 * If you Inject them in constructor you need to @Inject constructor, else if in class first you should
 * annotate that class with @AndroidEntryPoint then you specify its class and add @Inject annotation to head of that.
 * Because there are different lifecycles in Android, in @InstallIn parameter you specify
 * lifecycle of values that those class defines
 * This is SingletonComponent because those values should live as application does
